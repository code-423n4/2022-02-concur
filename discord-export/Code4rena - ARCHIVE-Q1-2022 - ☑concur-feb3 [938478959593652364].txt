where can I find the implementation of the external interfaces?


[02/03/2022 10:00 PM] derked
Are there any other docs to read generally about the purpose/intention of the protocol, intended user experience, etc. ? Thanks

There is no implementation for ICvx?


[02/04/2022 8:37 AM] termax
Will get back to you asap.


[02/04/2022 12:40 PM] czar102
Which contract (EOA?) is the `rewardNotifier` in `ConcurRewardPool`?


[02/04/2022 1:00 PM] termax
We made a pull request to the repo with updated README.md. Once it is accepted you will see more information about the project there.

Is the Library CvxMining.sol in scope?


[02/06/2022 1:52 AM] alextheentreprenerd
Is there any info on what `client` from `Shelter.client` does in `shareOf` and `totalShare` ?


[02/06/2022 8:23 AM] taek.eth
yup


[02/06/2022 8:23 AM] taek.eth
will add the example shelter client


[02/06/2022 3:45 PM] taek.eth
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/tree/shelter-client
this is how we are going to use convex wrapper as shelter client

What are the benefits of staking in concur vs directly in convex?


[02/08/2022 1:12 AM] pedroais
In what parts of the code is vote delegation handled ?


[02/08/2022 3:34 AM] termax
@taek


[02/08/2022 6:13 AM] pedroais
Also what's reward integral and user integral in ConvexStakingWrapper?


[02/08/2022 6:58 AM] taek.eth
vote delegation is handled with VoteProxy and snapshot.org
mostly offchain


[02/08/2022 6:58 AM] taek.eth
will be airdropping governance tokens to whom staked through our contract


[02/08/2022 6:59 AM] taek.eth
also pbm will absorb most of the liquidity from convex and make usdm pegged to 1$


[02/08/2022 7:00 AM] taek.eth
it is for forwarding convex rewards to users


[02/08/2022 7:58 AM] pedroais
Right. If I understand correctly the reward added for a user in an update is equal to _balance * (reward.integral - userI)) / 1e20


[02/08/2022 8:00 AM] pedroais
What are user and reward integrals representing exactly ?


[02/08/2022 8:28 AM] 0xleastwood
`reward.integral` is basically tracking the indexed reward


[02/08/2022 8:28 AM] 0xleastwood
so `reward.integral - userI` should be the change in indexed rewards attributable to the user


[02/08/2022 8:51 AM] pedroais
thanks


[02/09/2022 6:06 PM] rhynorater
I'm also having a hard time understanding the use of the integral. Is there a whitepaper on the math here? What is this designed to be trackign?

[04/12/2022 1:23 PM] czar102
Concur is being judged for more than a month now. Any prediction when will this phase end?


[04/12/2022 3:22 PM] itsmetechjay
Will check in on this one. I know it had over 250 issues so the judge is working through it.

Does the judge have an ETA?
